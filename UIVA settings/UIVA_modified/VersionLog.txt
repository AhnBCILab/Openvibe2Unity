- Update FAAST from 0.06 to 1.0 (by Evan Suma) in the release package
- Rebuilt UIVA_Server and UIVA_Client by "Release" in Visual Studio 2008. And replaced the original debug version of vrpnNet dll by the release version.
- Changed UIVA_Client to a C# class which can be put directly in the Unity game asset folder, rather than as a DLL file. So that calling its functions is easier, and possible to use UIVA in WebPlayer build.
- Made a new sample program which polls mouse events from VRPN_Mouse server and display them on the screen as GUI. Sample built both as Windows standalone and WebPlayer.
-Included SocketPolicyServer in the package to unlock Socket ports on the machine running UIVA_Server, so that UIVA can be used in games built as WebPlayer.
- UIVA 1.02 tested successfully in the following environment
	Windows 7 64 bit
	Visual Studio 2008 and 2010 installed (may not be necessary)
	Unity 3.5.5f3.
