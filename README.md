# OpenViBE2Unity

Brain-computer interface that may quantify humanâ€™s intention, cognition and feelings, is actively used in research and development. However, developing BCI application that performs data collection, real-time processing and feedback of output, is not a easy problem for the un-trained. Thus we developed OpenViBE2Unity, a BCI development API for OpenViBE and Unity3D that are popular in the fields and also effective in development.
